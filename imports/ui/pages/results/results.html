        The Trait Spectrum is a measure similar to the MBTI and Keirsey
        Temperament Sorter. It is founded in Jungian typology, and will deliver
        results in the form of 4 letters, each representing a trait. Each letter
        also has a percentage indicating the strength of your preference for
        that trait. Knowing your type can help you understand yourself better.
        It can enable you to maximize your strengths and compensate for your
        weaknesses. Once you obtain it, look up your 4-letter type online to
        find out more. Numerous websites provide descriptions of the types, and
        they are similar enough that you should be able to get a good idea of
        what your type is like by reading a few of them.
